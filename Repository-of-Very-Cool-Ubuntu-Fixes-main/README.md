# Repository-of-Very-Cool-Ubuntu-Fixes
Very cool, and pog.
That's basically it.

I have,
- A Mac FacetimeHD webcam fix (Needs to be run after every login unless I can change that...)
- A Mac Broadcom Wifi fix (needs to be run after every kernel update)
- A GLFW fix for Minecraft (2 or more keys at the same time have 500ms added input delay)
